## About Me
I am an aspiring actuary with a knack for coding and enjoy learning about machine learning/deep learning and it's applications into newer non-tradiational sectors. I am a statistics graduate and come from a computer science background. I look forward to being an actuarial data scientist some day, but in the meanwhile I am looking for entry level positions in data science profiles where I can leverage my broad variety of interdisciplinary skills such as in fields of finance, insurance, risk management and data science.

## Projects

+ Comparative analysis of most common machine learning algorithms to test their efficiency at detecting fruadulent credit card transactions
   
   The aim of this project is to build a classifier that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions using several machine-learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, artificial neural network and gradient boosting. In addition, determine which algorithm gives best results for given use case scenario and should be recommended in real life application using real life credit card transaction data.

+ Movie recommendation system

   The aim of this project is to build a recommendation engine that recommends movies to users based on similarity in viewing patterns from similar users using Item Based Collaborative Filter using R package “recommenderlab”.

+ Bird identifier (RShiny webapp)

   The aim of this project is to build and train a convolutional neural network based computer vision model and deploy it as a webapp using Rshiny. This app takes images in .jpg or .png format and tells top 5 results according to trained deep learning model what does it think this bird should be, along with it's probability.
