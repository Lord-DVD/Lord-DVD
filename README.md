### MetLife (Aug 2021 - Present)
#### Actuarial Analyst - Asset Modelling Group (ALM)
+ Optimized a multiple regression-based tool using R to predict the price of Fixed Maturity Assets to better report income in the balance sheet and provide a baseline for reporting income and set new reserves pre-emptively if necessary
+ Identified issues in original datasets and improved model efficiency by 40%, resulting in positive movement of over $119M towards actual value, for which got recognition award in MetLife and presented results to Global Chief Actuary and Appointed Actuary for US ALM
+ Maintained and ran Prophet models for quarterly asset projections for Cash Flow Testing, Loss Recognition Testing, Embedded Value Testing and Ad-hoc sensitivity tests pertaining to NY DFS regulatory requirements
+ Wrote & Improved DCS and Python scripts to automate several processes including but not limited to Cash Flow Projections, updating/ changing Model Point Files, adding post-processing manual changes to Model Point Files and other prophet input tables
+ Participated in Global Investment Assumption Committee for MetLife in setting asset performance assumptions for structured finances with a primary focus on CLOs/CDOs and other structured finance assets such as ABS, RBMS/CMBS, Private MBS and Agency/Non-Agency CMOs
+ Lead the testing of the new ALS Library-based asset projection Prophet model release for MetLife
+ Oversaw Azure Synapse-based SQL database for data ingestion/upload errors while working as a liaison between actuarial and IT teams

### The Sparks Foundation (Jun 2021 - Jul 2021)
#### Intern - Data Science and Business Analytics
+ Built a mixed machine learning model using Numerical and Textual analysis to predict stock prices
+ Analysed historical stock price data and news headlines and ran time series analysis, sentiment analysis and random forest regression algorithms
+ Achieved almost perfect fit on model which was able to explain 99.94% of variability present in data
