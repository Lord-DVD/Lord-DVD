## About Me
I am an aspiring actuary with a knack for coding and enjoy learning about machine learning/deep learning and it's applications into newer non-tradiational sectors. I am a statistics graduate and come from a computer science background. I look forward to being an actuarial data scientist some day, but in the meanwhile I am looking for entry level positions in data science profiles where I can leverage my broad variety of interdisciplinary skills such as in fields of finance, insurance, risk management and data science.

## Projects

+ Comparative analysis of most common machine learning algorithms to test their efficiency at detecting fruadulent credit card transactions
...The aim of this project is to build a classifier that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions using several machine-learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, artificial neural network and gradient boosting. In addition, determine which algorithm gives best results for given use case scenario and should be recommended in real life application using real life credit card transaction data.
