## About Me
I am an aspiring actuary with a knack for coding and enjoy learning about machine learning and its applications. I am a statistics major and a recent graduate who completed his graduation exams in May 2021 and am awaiting results. I look forward to being an actuarial data scientist in long term, and currently I am looking for entry-level positions in analytical roles where I can leverage my broad variety of interdisciplinary skills and gain experience in fields of consulting, insurance and risk management.

## Projects

+ ### Bird identifier (RShiny webapp)

   The aim of this project is to build and train a convolutional neural network based computer vision model and deploy it as a webapp using Rshiny. This app takes images in .jpg or .png format and tells top 5 results according to trained deep learning model what does it think this bird should be, along with it's probability.

+ ### Comparative analysis of most common machine learning algorithms to test their efficiency at detecting fruadulent credit card transactions
   
   The aim of this project is to build a classifier that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions using several machine-learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, artificial neural network and gradient boosting. In addition, determine which algorithm gives best results for given use case scenario and should be recommended in real life application using real life credit card transaction data.

+ ### Movie recommendation system

   The aim of this project is to build a recommendation engine that recommends movies to users based on similarity in viewing patterns from similar users using Item Based Collaborative Filter using R package “recommenderlab”.
